Introduction:
The objective of this assignment is to explore and visualize a dataset using the Python programming language, creating meaningful visualizations. This provides an opportunity to understand and apply the fundamental concepts of data analysis and visualization. I used the Google Collab to compile my codes and I wrote them to be suitable for this usage -I coded them which can be able to fetch the dataset from GitHub- 

1. About Dataset:
I choose a dataset from Kaggle, with at least 1000 rows and diverse data types to facilitate various types of visualizations.
The dataset was clear and i didn’t make any changes at data for cleaning it. 
The Titanic dataset contains information about the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, which sank on its maiden voyage in 1912 after hitting an iceberg. 
Here are the key features or columns in the Titanic dataset:
- PassengerId: A unique identifier assigned to each passenger.
- Survived: A binary variable indicating whether the passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0).
- Pclass (Passenger Class): The ticket class of the passenger, which can be 1st (1), 2nd (2), or 3rd (3) class.
- Name: The name of the passenger.
- Sex: The gender of the passenger (male or female).
- Age: The age of the passenger in years. It may contain missing values.
- SibSp: The number of siblings or spouses the passenger had aboard the Titanic.
- Parch: The number of parents or children the passenger had aboard the Titanic.
- Ticket: The ticket number.
- Fare: The amount of money the passenger paid for the ticket.
- Cabin: The cabin number where the passenger stayed. It may contain missing values.
- Embarked: The port at which the passenger boarded the Titanic (C for Cherbourg, Q for Queenstown, S for Southampton).
2. Research Questions:

•	What is the age distribution of the passengers on the ship?
•	What is the gender distribution of the passengers on the ship?
•	What is the passanger class distribution of the passengers on the ship?
•	How is the age distribution of passengers on the ship based on gender?
•	How is the survival status of passengers on the ship based on gender?

3.Visualization Techniques:
I used pyhton to dorw the plots and charts. I used the Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib libraries to create KDEplot, pie chart, donut chart, violin plot and histogram. Than i made them interactive plots using by plotly.express library.

Conclusion:
In this documentation, firstly I introduced the dataset I used. Then, I asked various questions to understand this dataset. This assignment covers many visualization techniques for making effective data analysis.
